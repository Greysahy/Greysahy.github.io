    Hi there! I am a Master Student at the Zhejiang University.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, my research is centered on trustworthy LLMs, with a specific emphasis on improving the reliability and robustness of LLM agents, LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS), and large reasoning models. I'm especially interested in mitigating risks such as prompt injection in these systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research!
  </p>
